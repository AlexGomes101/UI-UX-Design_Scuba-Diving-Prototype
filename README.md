# UI-UX-Design_Scuba-Diving-Prototype
Prototype for Scuba Diving using Axure-RP 10

Here I have built a prototype for amateur scuba divers and snorkelers. Users will be able to track and view their diving activities (such as their (current) depth, ascent time, remaining air in the monitoring tank, dive duration, etc.). And also can see their underwater diving experience through pictures/videos. Underwater mode has been added to get the best or hassle-free diving experience underwater.
